         <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
         <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
         <p>I was excited to see the job posting for the position at your company. I’ve been working as a Salesforce Administrator and IT Manager for the past six months for University of Arkansas Little Rock’s Alumni and Development Department, and feel confident that I could be valuable to your organization given this opportunity.</p>
         <p>Since joining the Alumni and Development Department and over my 5 years at the university, I have developed a solid understanding of the University's enterprise environment and the operations that support it. I’ve collaborated with various external vendors for integrations such as SSO on systems such as ServiceNow, Salesforce, and others. I have experience in full migrations of in house applications both for the front and back end. As a Field Technician I often had to delegate to, train, and manage multiple student workers on different projects. Now as a Salesforce Administrator and IT Manager, I’ve grown technical expertise in the areas of report writing, automation, and data synchronization between systems with Snaplogic. I’ve also been able to gain experience in user administration on these different systems. </p>
         <p>I’m confident that my proven record of service, work ethic, and performance in my past roles will make me an immediate asset to your company, the specific department, and allow me to contribute to the company’s success. I look forward to discussing the position with you and my qualifications in more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience and can be reached at any of the contact means I’ve provided below. I will be in touch in a week to make sure that you have received my application. </p>
         <p>Thank you for your considersation,</p>

         <h2>Database Project 2</h2>
         <p>As part of my final project for my Social Computing class, I worked with a large dataset by setting up a Proxmox virtual environment at home to create a database. I collected post titles, upvotes, and comments from the /r/HuntShowdown subreddit and performed sentiment analysis using VADER and ChatGPT on a week's worth of data. Currently, I have data dating back to the beginning of the subreddit, and I plan to expand this research into my capstone project by analyzing sentiment trends over time. The first picture below is an example of the tables how they are currently set up. This is due to the nature of the way the data was scraped. Comments were scraped for a month, then posts. All posts and comments contain an id field that they can be joined on, and this is next step in making more easier to view tables to follow for the sentiment analysis.</p>

               <p>For my final project in my Associate’s Degree, I worked with a teammate, Justin Bryant, to develop a full level of a game in Java. With around three months and only prior experience in Minecraft, we set out to create a Mega Man-inspired platformer. There's even an unfinished hidden level 2 that never got completed. I vividly remember spending countless hours making sure the health packs worked correctly. This experience was invaluable, teaching me a lot about game development and the importance of teamwork. None of this would have been possible without Justin’s collaboration.</p>

         <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
         <p>1. Proven ability to collaborate across multiple departments, and leading teams, streamlining processes for better productivity.</p>
         <ul> An example of this would be my work with IT Services, especially during the pandemic where I oversaw the order, imaging, and deployment of IT Services first bulk computer order. Over that summer we installed/replaced over 250 workstations across campus. This was a herculean effort involving collaboration from multiple teams and end users to coordinate times.</ul>
         <p>2. Strong communication and customer service skills, ensuring seamless interactions with users and stakeholders.</p>
         <ul> An example of this would be my work as Help Desk at the beginning of my time IT Services. </ul>
